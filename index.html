  <h2>About TRAS</h2>
  <p>
    The Roblox Aced Show (TRAS) is a yearly season based tournament that has multiple brackets and elo based on placements. At the end of the season, the player with the most elo will be crowned champion.
    The tournament is meant to be a competitive one, but mainly for fun expirience. As there are awards and prize pools, there are no plans to make this a MASSIVE event for everyon to join in on. Games also do not collaborate with this tournament.
